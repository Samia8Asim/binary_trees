# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It covers the concepts and implementation of binary trees and their variants, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
